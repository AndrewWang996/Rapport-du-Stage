\section{Context: Hydrocarbon Exploration}

The processes of Reverse Time Migration and solving forward problems in creating images of the underground is primarily used in the field of hydrocarbon exploration. This relatively recent field has its origins in the 1900's, but most of the major oil pockets have already been discovered and now the job of hydrocarbon exploration becomes more difficult and necessary in underground zones that are smaller and harder to image. Add to this the difficulties of the often mountainous or forest-heavy terrain above the surface, and we can see that the hydrocarbon exploration is an increasingly complicated field in both the geophysical and mathematical domains. 

The cost of discovering a barrel has skyrocketed more than three-fold over the last decade due to these increasingly inhospitable environmental conditions and a fairly constant reduction of existing reserves at $5-15\%$ per year \cite{hydrocarbonExplorationCosts}. In addition, political risks associated with the discovery and drilling of new oil wells have been escalating. For example, the USA, Russia, Canada, Denmark, Iceland, and Norway have competing claims over the Arctic Circle where approximately a fifth of the world's recoverable oil is contained. Although Uganda has more than 2 billion barrels of oil, necessary negotiations between the government and oil companies have been slow. In 2009, 3D seismic surveys cost on average between \$40,000 and \$100,000 per square mile. \cite{hydrocarbonExplorationCosts}

In the domain of hydrocarbon exploration, there is a long and complicated sequence of data processing given the seismic surveys generated from the energy sources and receivers. The goal of this sequence of steps is to generate from the data an accurate image of the 3-dimensional interior of the earth for analysis by geophysicists. Specifically, the data consists of the measurement of energy that the receivers record over time after a signal has been sent by the source and reflected by heterogeneities within the earth.

Seismic acquisition is the process of gathering the data, sometimes called seismic surveys, from the receivers, whether it be in a land or maritime environment. Typically, it involves one source, which can be a vibroseis / vibrator truck or dynamite, that sends out a pulse or multiple pulses also known as seismic waves. Due to differences in physical characteristics in the underground media, the signal may get refracted, reflected, or converted.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	\textbf{Reflection}: When the wave encounters a change in \textbf{acoustic impedance} (propagation velocity multiplied by density of the medium), part of the energy of the wave is reflected in the direction from which it came. The fraction of energy that is reflected is called the \textbf{reflection coefficient}. It depends on the incidence angle in certain media that are called \textbf{anisotropic}.
	\item
	\textbf{Refraction}: When the wave encounters a difference in \textbf{propagation velocity}, the wave refracts and changes its direction according to Snell's law. 
\end{enumerate}
