\section{Conclusions}

It seems that the mathematical complexity of seismic imaging algorithms derives from the variety of differential equations (acoustic, elastic), the variety of absorbing boundary conditions or Perfectly Matched Layers, the variety of environments (TTI, VTI, anisotropic domains), that each deserve separate treatments. Especially for the unique differential equations, there exist very unique ways to solve each one and make speed improvements in the Finite Element or Discontinuous Galerkin or Finite Volume or Finite Difference Methods. Overall, no technique has yet been developed to deal with arbitrary differential equations.
