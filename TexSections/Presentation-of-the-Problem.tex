\section{Presentation of the Problem}

The problem that we are trying to solve is the simulation of the propagation of waves. In this section, we present the problem in the context of seismic imaging, an essential component of the seismic processing. We explain its importance in various methods such as Reverse Time Migration, as well as how as a forward problem, numerical simulation is also essential to its counterpart, the inverse problem.
